            <h3>Details about your secondary model selection.</h3>
            <p>

                We selected the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for our model selection process due to its
                several advantages over other models:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Ability to Capture Non-Linear Relationships: </strong>MLPs are capable of capturing non-linear
                    relationships
                    in the data thanks to their multi-layer neural network structure, making them suitable for our task
                    where
                    the relationship between phone specifications and price range may not be linear.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Flexibility in Architecture: </strong> MLPs allow flexibility in architecture design, including
                    the number and
                    size of hidden layers. In our case, we designed a network with multiple hidden layers and varying
                    sizes to
                    accommodate the complexity of phone specifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Handling Large Datasets Efficiently: </strong>MLPs can efficiently handle large and complex
                    datasets, which is
                    beneficial for our task where we have a plethora of phone specifications to train the model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Built-in Regularization: </strong> MLPs come with built-in regularization methods, such as the
                    alpha
                    regularization parameter we utilized, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights in
                    the
                    network.
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Proven Performance in Classification Problems: </strong>MLPs have demonstrated good performance
                    across a wide
                    range of classification problems, giving us confidence in their ability to accurately predict phone
                    price
                    ranges based on provided specifications.
                </li>
            </ul>





            Regarding the specific details of the MLP classifier used, it has the following characteristics:

            <li>
                Hidden Layer Sizes: (10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20, 10, 20, 20, 10)
            </li>

            <li>
                Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
            </li>

            <li>
                Regularization Parameter (Alpha): 0.001
            </li>

            </p>

            <h3>Information on validation methods and the metrics employed.</h3>
            <p>
                For our machine learning model, we are using the holdout validation method, where we split our dataset
                into a
                training set (70%) and a test set (30%).



            </p>

            <p>To assess the performance of our model, we implemented rigorous validation methods along with the
                accuracy metric. This metric was chosen because all classes carry equal weight in our classification
                problem. Additionally, we ran the validation code 1000 times to obtain a more robust distribution of the
                metric. On average, our accuracy hovers around 0.80, indicating a high level of precision in classifying
                the samples</p>

            <h3>Preliminary conclusions drawn from your analysis to date.</h1>
                <p>
                    Por supuesto, aquí tienes una versión revisada:

                    "In conclusion, our MLP classifier has
                    shown promising performance in predicting the price range of mobiles from 0 to 3, where 0 represents
                    the least expensive and 3 the most expensive. Upon analyzing the confusion matrix, we observe strong
                    predictive accuracy, correctly categorizing mobiles in price range 0 with 91% accuracy, range 1 with
                    73% accuracy, range 2 with 79% accuracy, and range 3 with 79% accuracy. However, we note a minor
                    issue where mobiles in range 2 are occasionally misclassified as belonging to range 1, occurring
                    approximately 18% of the time. This highlights an area for potential refinement to improve overall
                    model accuracy and reliability."
