        <section id="details" class="parrafo">

            <h3>Details about your secondary model selection.</h3>
            <p>

                We selected the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for our model selection process due to its
                several advantages over other models:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Ability to Capture Non-Linear Relationships: </strong>MLPs are capable of capturing non-linear
                    relationships
                    in the data thanks to their multi-layer neural network structure, making them suitable for our task
                    where
                    the relationship between phone specifications and price range may not be linear.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Flexibility in Architecture: </strong> MLPs allow flexibility in architecture design, including
                    the number and
                    size of hidden layers. In our case, we designed a network with multiple hidden layers and varying
                    sizes to
                    accommodate the complexity of phone specifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Handling Large Datasets Efficiently: </strong>MLPs can efficiently handle large and complex
                    datasets, which is
                    beneficial for our task where we have a plethora of phone specifications to train the model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Built-in Regularization: </strong> MLPs come with built-in regularization methods, such as the
                    alpha
                    regularization parameter we utilized, which helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights in
                    the
                    network.
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Proven Performance in Classification Problems: </strong>MLPs have demonstrated good performance
                    across a wide
                    range of classification problems, giving us confidence in their ability to accurately predict phone
                    price
                    ranges based on provided specifications.
                </li>
            </ul>





            Regarding the specific details of the MLP classifier used, it has the following characteristics:

            <li>
                Hidden Layer Sizes: (10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20, 10, 20, 20, 10)
            </li>

            <li>
                Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
            </li>

            <li>
                Regularization Parameter (Alpha): 0.001
            </li>

            <h3>Information on validation methods and the metrics employed.</h3>
            <p>
                For our machine learning model, we are using the holdout validation method, where we split our dataset
                into a
                training set (70%) and a test set (30%).



            </p>

            <p>To assess the performance of our model, we implemented rigorous validation methods along with the
                accuracy metric. This metric was chosen because all classes carry equal weight in our classification
                problem. Additionally, we ran the validation code 1000 times to obtain a more robust distribution of the
                metric. On average, our accuracy hovers around 0.80, indicating a high level of precision in classifying
                the samples</p>

            <h3>Preliminary conclusions drawn from your analysis to date.</h1>
                <p>

                    In conclusion, our MLP classifier has
                    shown promising performance in predicting the price range of mobiles from 0 to 3, where 0 represents
                    the least expensive and 3 the most expensive. Upon analyzing the confusion matrix, we observe strong
                    predictive accuracy, correctly categorizing mobiles in price range 0 with 91% accuracy, range 1 with
                    73% accuracy, range 2 with 79% accuracy, and range 3 with 79% accuracy. However, we note a minor
                    issue where mobiles in range 2 are occasionally misclassified as belonging to range 1, occurring
                    approximately 18% of the time. This highlights an area for potential refinement to improve overall
                    model accuracy and reliability.

            <h3>How does this model compare to the first one in terms of metrics? </h1>
                <p>
                    Our secondary model has shown a notable performance in
                    predicting mobile price ranges. When compared to the initial model, the key metrics for both models
                    are as follows:

                    - <strong>Accuracy</strong>: The secondary model achieved an average accuracy of 0.80, while the initial model
                    had an accuracy of 0.52. This indicates an improvement in the overall classification performance.
                    <br>
                    -<strong>Class-specific Accuracy</strong>
                    <br>
                    - For price range 0, the secondary model has an accuracy of 91%, compared to 72% in the initial
                    model.
                    <br>
                    - For price range 1, the secondary model achieved 73% accuracy, while the initial model achieved
                    49%.
                    <br>
                    - For price range 2, the secondary model reached 79% accuracy, whereas the initial model had 32%.
                    <br>
                    - For price range 3, the secondary model has 79% accuracy, compared to 51% in the initial model.

                    Overall, the secondary model demonstrates a consistent improvement across all price ranges, with a
                    particular strength in accurately predicting the least expensive category (price range 0). However,
                    as noted, there is still a misclassification issue in predicting price range 2 as range 1, which
                    requires further optimization. Despite this, the secondary model outperforms the initial model in
                    terms of both average accuracy and class-specific accuracy, making it a more reliable choice for
                    estimating mobile price ranges.
